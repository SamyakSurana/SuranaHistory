<p style="color:Black;"> After a little digging, I managed to find that we belong to the Royals of Rajasthan. We belong to the Rajputs. Our Sub Group is the Parmars(Panwars)/Sankhala.
<br>
<br>
Our Sub-Social Group are Oswal. Oswalâ€™s are a Jain Community with Origins in the Marwar Region of Rajasthan and Tharparkar district of Sindh.

<h3> The Story Behind Surana. </h3>
<p style="color:Black;"> King Madhidev had three sons Sur, Sankh and Sanwal. Sanwal had three sons Sukha, Salde and Punamde. The Surana decend from Suro the well known Panwar/Parmar hero who lived in the court of Siddha raj Jaisingh king of Patan. Gajani's sixteen attack was on Somnath temple. Gajni would go through his kingdom. Gajni to loot and destroy all the places he passed by so Suro went to well know Jain Acharya Sri Hemsuri ji requested him to save the state. Acharya Hemsuri first demanded as a condition that Suro and his brothers should embrace Jainism and the condition having being accepted & he gave him a Vijayapataka Yantra by means of which he become able to rout the enemy. There upon Siddha raj Jaisingh welcomed Suro with the words shabash Surana & it is from this phrase the term Surana was derived . All the three brothers converted to Jainism. The Generation of Suro was called Surana ,Sankh's family was called Sankhla, Sanwal ran away from the battle field so his family was named Siyal (Jackal). </p>

<p style="color:Black;"> There is also another theory. Some other sources say that Sur Singh Paramara went to Ghori to get taxes for Pritviraj Chauhan. He was refused and they fought. Sur Singh killed 74 Ghurids until he died. 
<br>
Sur Singh had 2 sons. Molana accepted Jainism. He partially built the Maa Suswani Temple in Bikaner. His descents settled in Naugar. They got Surana from Sur in Sur Singh.</p>
